According to data released by NHS Digital nearly 100,000 older people (aged 65+) suffered hip fractures in 2017/18.

Record show that 80% of hospitalisation on elderly are fall related injury. And most people donâ€™t recover. My own mother is using wheelchair after falling from her home. Therefore, we need affordable personal alarms that can help elderly who live alone feel safer and more secure by providing contact to the outside world in the event of an emergency.

 These alarms allow people to call for assistance if they have an accident or a fall at home by just press a button. We are online business selling these live saving items to UK residents. We only have a system where you can buy the product and we can ship it to your home address.

We are planning to incorporate additional feature at later stage. For example: Membership where the customer will be able to subscribe and pay annual fees and benefit from the 24/7 monitoring service provided by the company.
